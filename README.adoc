= Berriedale

The realistic goal for this project is to become an exercise in building a
compiler for me. The fantasy goal however is to build a JVM-compatible Ada
compiler which takes link:http://www.adacore.com/adaanswers/about/ada-2012/[Ada
2012] in one side, and emits JVM bytecode out the other.


== Hacking

This project uses link:http://gradle.org[Gradle] for its build and dependency
management. It is assumed that developers will be running on at least JDK7 or
later.

* Testing: `./gradlew check`
* Packaging: `./gradlew assemble`
